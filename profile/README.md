🙋‍♀️ What is Adige?

A team dedicated to creating a simulation verifier, a piece of code that will reinforce confidence that the simulation represents reality. 
To support the project, we provide simulation services enhanced by a data crunching approach to create an environment in which our simulation takes onth the reality.


👩‍💻 Useful resources
